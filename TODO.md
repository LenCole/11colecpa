* The Header/Hero
  * What do you offer
  * How will you make my life better
  * What do I need to do to buy it
* The Stakes
  * What you customer's life would look like if they don't do business with you.
* The Value Proposition
  * Position product/service as the solution to the problem in Stakes
* The Guide
  * empathy and authority. Empathy is meant to connect with your potential customers and let them know you understand their problem. Authority is meant to show that you can solve your customer’s problem.
  * "We understand" and then begin to hit on your customer’s external, internal, and philosophical problems
  * Customer testamonials, logos of brands you work with, results your customers have attained.
* The Plan
  * The plan section communicates to your potential customers how easy it is to do business with you. This is shown in a simple 3-step process.
  * You can begin thinking through your plan by determining the three steps customers need to take to do business with you. Something simple like
    1. Go to our website
    2. Purchase a product
    3. Enjoy your product will suffice. Keep your plan simple and actionable.
* The Explanatory Paragraph
  * The explanatory paragraph is meant to supply more detail to your brand story. For potential customers looking to check another credibility box, this is the section that will do that for them. This is also where you can include more descriptive keywords for your on-page SEO.
  * Most companies write their long-form BrandScript as their explanatory paragraph. This is what we’d recommend as well. Simply start with your character, their problem, the guide, and so on and so forth. It’s also wise to write one paragraph and then include a “Read More” dropdown link for those who want to read more of your explanatory paragraph. This way you don’t have a lot of text on your StoryBrand website.
* The Video
  * The video section is optional and for those companies that have the capability to create a 2-3-minute video. This is a simple video that details your brand story and what you have to offer.
* The Price Choices
  * The price choices section is meant to show your customers the packages or products you offer. Even if you offer more than three products, this is the section to display your best three products/packages or the ones that customers most often purchase.
* The Junk Drawer (footer)
  *  This is where you’ll include links to your about page, your blog, your employment opportunities, and several other links that aren’t related to your direct call-to-action.
